## What Was Migrated

### 1. **Admin Lesson Management System**
- âœ… `/admin/lessons` - Lesson listing page with search, filters, and CRUD operations
- âœ… `/admin/lessons/new` - Create new lessons with metadata
- âœ… `/admin/lessons/[id]/edit` - Full lesson editor with drag-and-drop steps (589 lines)
- âœ… Protected with `platform_admin` role checking

### 2. **Lesson Player for Students**
- âœ… `/lesson/[id]` - Dynamic lesson player with all step types (2817 lines)
- âœ… Protected for logged-in users only
- âœ… Supports 13+ different step types including the new `unit_reference`

### 3. **Step Form Components** (9 components)
- âœ… `ScenarioStepForm` - Text scenarios with cultural context

- âœ… Role-based access control using `platform_admin` role
- âœ… Middleware updated to protect `/admin` and `/lesson` routes

### 5. **Database Integration**
- âœ… Verified `lessons` and `pillars` tables exist in Supabase
- âœ… All lesson-queries functions working with Neptune's Tribe schema
- âœ… Whitelist pattern for safe database updates
- âœ… Added `getLessonsForUnit()` and `getLessonById()` helper functions

### 6. **Design System Adaptation**
- âœ… All `blue-*` colors replaced with `primary-*` colors
- âœ… All `bg-gray-900` replaced with `bg-primary-900` for dark mode
- âœ… Consistent with Neptune's Tribe's color scheme:
  - Primary: Blue tones (#5E82A6, #4C6B8A, etc.)
  - Accent: Warm tones (#C69963, #B78343, etc.)
- âœ… All rounded corners, borders, and spacing match existing pages

## New Features Added

### **Unit Reference Step Type** ðŸŽ¯
This is a key integration feature that bridges existing Neptune's Tribe units with the new lesson system:

**In the Admin Editor:**
- Admins can select any existing unit from the `units` table
- Preview shows unit theme, difficulty, and description
- Optional instructions field for additional guidance

**In the Lesson Player:**
- Renders the selected unit's multi-gap-fill exercise
- Students complete it just like in the regular Units section
- Seamlessly integrated into lesson flow

**Benefits:**
- No content duplication
- Units remain accessible from both `/units` and within lessons
- Lessons can reference multiple units as different steps
- Original units functionality completely preserved

---

## Files Created

```
components/admin/step-forms/UnitReferenceStepForm.js
MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md (this file)
```

## Files Modified

### Core Auth & Routing
```
components/AuthProvider.js - Simplified for NextAuth
components/ProtectedRoute.js - Updated to check users.role

```
app/(site)/admin/lessons/page.js - Lesson listing (styling + auth)
app/(site)/admin/lessons/new/page.js - Create lesson (styling + auth)
app/(site)/admin/lessons/[id]/edit/page.js - Lesson editor (styling + auth + new step type)
```

### Lesson Player

## How to Use

### For Platform Admins

1. **Set Your Role in Supabase:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET role = 'platform_admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   ```

2. **Access the Admin Panel:**
   - Navigate to `/admin/lessons`
   - You'll see the lesson management dashboard

3. **Create a New Lesson:**
   - Click "Create New Lesson"
   - Fill in title, description, pillar, difficulty, etc.
   - Click "Create Lesson"

4. **Add Steps to Your Lesson:**
   - In the editor, click the "+ Add Step" dropdown
   - Choose a step type (try "Unit Reference" first!)
   - For Unit Reference: select a unit from the dropdown
   - Fill in the step details
   - Drag steps to reorder them
   - Click "Save"

5. **Preview & Test:**
   - Click "Preview" to see the lesson as students will
   - Make adjustments as needed

### For Students

- Navigate to `/lesson/[lesson-id]`
- Complete each step sequentially
- Earn XP upon completion
- Progress is tracked automatically

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. **Auth Strategy**
- **Decision:** Use NextAuth for authentication, Supabase for user data storage
- **Rationale:** Neptune's Tribe already uses NextAuth + Google OAuth
- **Implementation:** `AuthProvider` wraps `useSession()`, `ProtectedRoute` queries Supabase for role

### 2. **Role Field**
- **Decision:** Use `'platform_admin'` as the admin role value
- **Rationale:** Future-proofing for school roles (`'teacher'`, `'school_admin'`)
- **Implementation:** Role stored in `users.role` field

### 3. **Units Integration**
- **Decision:** Option A+B hybrid - Keep units separate but add linking via `unit_reference` step type
- **Rationale:** Safest approach, preserves existing functionality, allows gradual integration
- **Implementation:** New step type component + rendering case in player

### 4. **Styling Approach**
- **Decision:** Systematic find-and-replace of all blue color references
- **Rationale:** Neptune's Tribe uses primary/accent color system consistently
- **Implementation:** Bash sed replacements + targeted MultiEdit operations

### 5. **Pillars Table**
- **Decision:** Keep pillars table but make it optional
- **Rationale:** Can be repurposed for weekly themes or categories later
- **Current Usage:** Lessons can optionally assign to a pillar

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying, test the following:

### Admin Flow
- [ ] Login as platform_admin
- [ ] Access `/admin/lessons` (should load)
- [ ] Create a new lesson with all fields
- [ ] Add a unit_reference step pointing to an existing unit
- [ ] Add other step types (scenario, vocabulary, etc.)
- [ ] Reorder steps via drag-and-drop
- [ ] Save lesson
- [ ] Edit lesson
- [ ] Clone lesson
- [ ] Delete lesson
- [ ] Preview lesson

### Student Flow
- [ ] Login as regular user (non-admin)
- [ ] Try to access `/admin/lessons` (should redirect)
- [ ] Access `/lesson/[id]` for a lesson you created
- [ ] Complete a unit_reference step
- [ ] Complete other step types
- [ ] Navigate through all steps
- [ ] Complete lesson and receive XP
- [ ] Verify completion tracked in database

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Access `/units/[unitId]` - should still work normally
- [ ] Complete a unit from `/units` section
- [ ] Access same unit via lesson's unit_reference step
- [ ] Verify both work identically
- [ ] Check that challenges section still works
- [ ] Check that eco-map page still works

## Next Steps & Future Enhancements

### Immediate
1. **Test thoroughly** with a real lesson containing multiple step types
2. **Create your first lesson** linking to an existing unit
3. **Verify RLS policies** in Supabase for lessons table

### Short-term
1. **Add weekly themes integration** - Filter lessons by active weekly theme
2. **Add lesson navigation** - Display related lessons on unit pages
3. **Import existing content** - Migrate any existing lesson content to new format

### Medium-term
1. **Unit content CMS** - Extend admin to allow editing unit content (not just lessons)
2. **Lesson analytics** - Track completion rates, time spent, etc.
3. **Lesson preview mode** - Let admins test lessons without marking them complete

### Long-term
1. **AI-powered features** - Translation, voice-over, feedback (already in components, needs API keys)
2. **Lesson templates** - Create templates for common lesson structures
3. **Student dashboard** - Show progress through lesson sequences

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Unit Reference Step:** Currently passes empty array for `units` prop to MultiGapFillExerciseNew. If that component needs the full units array, we'll need to fetch it.

2. **Lesson-Unit Association:** The `getLessonsForUnit()` function uses a JSON containment search which may not be the most efficient. Consider adding a dedicated `unit_id` column to lessons table for better performance.

3. **Pillar Filtering:** Pillars are kept but not actively used. Consider repurposing for weekly themes or removing if unused.

4. **AI Features:** Several step types (AISpeechPractice, AIWriting, AIConversation, etc.) require external API keys (OpenAI, ElevenLabs) which may not be configured yet.

## Troubleshooting

### "User not authorized" when accessing /admin/lessons
**Solution:** Make sure your user's `role` field in the `users` table is set to `'platform_admin'`:
```sql
UPDATE users SET role = 'platform_admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Lesson editor shows "Unknown step type"
**Solution:** Make sure the step type is added to both:
1. The `STEP_TYPES` array in the editor
2. The `renderStepForm()` switch statement in the editor
3. The `renderStepContent()` switch statement in the player

### Unit Reference step shows empty exercise
**Solution:** Verify that `currentStepData.unit_id` is set correctly and points to a valid unit in the `units` table.

### Styling looks different from rest of site
**Solution:** All styling should use `primary-*` and `accent-*` colors. Check for any remaining `blue-*` references:
```bash
grep -r "blue-" app/(site)/admin app/(site)/lesson components/admin
```

---

## Database Schema Notes

### Users Table
```sql
-- Ensure role column exists
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role TEXT DEFAULT 'free';

-- Set yourself as admin
UPDATE users SET role = 'platform_admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

### Lessons Table
Already exists from FieldTalk import with:
- `id` (UUID)
- `title`, `description`, `description_pt`
- `pillar_id` (references pillars table)
- `difficulty` (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert)
- `xp_reward` (INTEGER)
- `content` (JSONB) - stores array of steps
- `is_active` (BOOLEAN)
- `target_audience` (users, schools, both)
- And many more fields...

### Pillars Table
Already exists, currently unused but available for categorization.
