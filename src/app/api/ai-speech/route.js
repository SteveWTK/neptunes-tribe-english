Analyze this English pronunciation attempt by a BEGINNER Brazilian football player:

Expected text: "${expectedText}"
What they said: "${transcript}"

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- This is a BEGINNER student - be VERY encouraging and positive!
- Give scores between 75-95 for any reasonable attempt (reserve below 75 only for completely incorrect responses)
- ACCEPT ALL ACCENT VARIATIONS as correct (British, American, Australian, Irish, Scottish, South African, etc.)
- DO NOT penalize for accent differences - only correct if the word is completely wrong or unintelligible
- Focus on whether they communicated the message, not on perfect native-like pronunciation
- Praise their effort and courage to speak English!

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- pronunciation_score: 75-85 for basic attempts, 85-90 for good attempts, 90-95 for excellent attempts
- accuracy_score: Did they say the right words? Be lenient - accept synonyms and accent variations
- overall_score: Average of the two, biased towards being encouraging

Provide feedback in ${feedbackLanguage} in this JSON format:
{
  "pronunciation_score": 85,
  "accuracy_score": 90,
  "overall_score": 87,
  "strengths": ["At least 2-3 positive specific things they did well"],
  "improvements": ["Only 1-2 gentle, simple suggestions if really needed"],
  "encouragement": "A very positive and motivational message!",
  "specific_tips": ["1-2 simple, practical tips - be encouraging!"],
  "next_focus": "One simple thing to work on next - phrase it positively!"
}

Be extremely encouraging and specific. Praise their effort. Remember: different accents (British 'tomahto' vs American 'tomayto', British 'shedule' vs American 'skedule', etc.) are ALL CORRECT. Only flag true errors where the word is wrong or incomprehensible.
