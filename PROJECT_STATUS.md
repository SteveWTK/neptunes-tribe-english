# Neptune's Tribe English - Project Status

**Last Updated:** October 27, 2025

## Project Overview
Neptune's Tribe English is an educational platform for teaching English through interactive lessons, games, and themed learning adventures organized by world regions.

## Recent Development Session Summary

### Completed Features

#### 1. Word Snake Game Integration ✅
- **Location:** `src/components/WordSnakeLesson.js`
- Inline word snake game component for lesson flows
- Accepts custom clues from lesson content (clue, answer, hint, fact)
- Features:
  - Snake movement with letter collection
  - Crossword-style answer display with individual letter boxes
  - Letter spawning every 2.5 seconds (70% correct, 20% random, 10% eraser)
  - Wall collision detection (snake dies, no wrapping)
  - Power-ups (eraser ⌫ removes last letter)
  - Educational facts shown on word completion
  - Multi-word answer support with automatic space insertion
- **Mobile Controls:** Swipe gesture implementation (just completed!)
  - Swipe up/down/left/right on canvas to control snake
  - No visible D-pad - full canvas visibility
  - Small floating backspace button (bottom-right) appears when needed
  - Minimum swipe: 30px, max time: 300ms for responsive controls

#### 2. World & Adventure CMS Integration ✅
- **Files Modified:**
  - `src/app/(site)/admin/lessons/new/page.js`
  - `src/app/(site)/admin/lessons/[id]/edit/page.js`
  - `src/lib/supabase/lesson-queries.js`
- Added World and Adventure dropdown selectors to lesson creation/editing forms
- Dependent dropdowns (adventure disabled until world selected)
- Data properly saves to Supabase:
  - `world` column stores world ID (e.g., "south_america")
  - `theme_tags` column stores array with adventure theme tag (e.g., ["amazon_rainforest"])
- **Critical Fix:** Added 'world' and 'theme_tags' to allowedFields arrays in lesson-queries.js

#### 3. Dynamic World Navigation ✅
- **File:** `src/app/(site)/lesson/[id]/page.js`
- `getWorldUrl()` helper function extracts world from lesson and returns proper slug-based URL
- Students return to specific world page after completing lesson (e.g., `/worlds/south-america`)
- Back button shows world name instead of generic "Worlds"
- All navigation maintains world context

#### 4. Merged Units & Lessons Display ✅
- **File:** `src/app/(site)/worlds/[worldId]/page.js`
- Merged "Foundation Units" and "Lessons" into single "Learning Activities" section
- `loadAdventureContent()` function:
  1. Loads lessons for adventure (by theme_tags)
  2. Loads units for adventure (by theme_tags)
  3. Matches units to lessons via `unit_reference` steps
  4. Attaches unit data to each lesson object
- Display shows lesson with associated unit image (16x16 thumbnail)
- Reduces content creator workload by reusing existing unit images

#### 5. Lesson Step Types
- **word_snake:** Interactive word snake game with custom clues
- **unit_reference:** Displays multi-gap fill units in modal overlay
- Both integrated into lesson renderer: `src/app/(site)/lesson/[id]/page.js`

## Technical Architecture

### Key Configuration Files
- **`src/data/worldsConfig.js`** - Central config for worlds and adventures
  - Structure: `WORLDS[worldId] = { id, slug, name, color, adventures[] }`
  - Adventures: `{ id, name, themeTag, description, icon }`

### Database Schema (Supabase)
- **lessons table:**
  - `world` (text) - World ID
  - `theme_tags` (text[]) - Array of adventure theme tags
  - `content` (jsonb) - Lesson steps with type and data
- **units table:**
  - `theme_tags` (text[]) - Links to adventures
  - `image` (text) - Thumbnail for lesson display

### Component Patterns
- **Refs for interval stability:** Used `useRef` + functional setState to prevent interval restarts
- **Modal overlays:** Units display in full-screen modal while preserving lesson layout
- **Responsive design:** Mobile-first with MD breakpoint for desktop

---

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Letters Not Spawning (SOLVED ✅)
**Problem:** Only first letter appeared, no more spawned after collection.

**Solution:** Used refs (`collectedWordRef`, `snakeRef`) to access current values without adding them to effect dependencies. This prevents interval from restarting when state changes.

```javascript
const collectedWordRef = useRef("");
useEffect(() => { collectedWordRef.current = collectedWord; }, [collectedWord]);

// In interval effect, access via ref instead of state
const currentCollected = collectedWordRef.current.replace(/\s+/g, "");
```

### Issue: Mobile Controls Obstructing Canvas (SOLVED ✅)
**Problem:** Original D-pad controls below canvas required scrolling. Floating overlay still obscured game board on small screens.

**Solution:** Implemented swipe gesture controls directly on canvas. Users swipe to control direction - no visible controls needed. Small backspace button only appears when letters are collected.

---

## Current Git Status
**Branch:** main
**Uncommitted Changes:**
- `src/components/WordSnakeGame.js` (modified)

---

## Next Steps & Future Work

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Test swipe controls on actual mobile devices** - Verify 30px/300ms parameters feel responsive
2. **Small adjustments to Word Snake game** (as mentioned by user)
3. **Continue project development** (user will specify next features)

### Potential Enhancements
- Add swipe tutorial overlay on first game load for mobile users
- Consider haptic feedback for letter collection on mobile
- Add gesture for backspace (e.g., two-finger tap or long press)
- Performance optimization if needed for older mobile devices

### Content Creator Tools
- All CMS integration complete for lesson creation
- World/Adventure selection working properly
- Unit images automatically displayed with lessons

---

## Development Environment
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **UI Library:** React 18
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Animation:** Framer Motion
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Working Directory:** `c:\Developer\INSPIRE\neptunes-tribe-english`

## Important Notes for Tomorrow

1. **Swipe controls just implemented** - This is brand new, hasn't been tested on mobile yet
2. **All lesson integration work is complete** - Full workflow from CMS to student experience
3. **No pending critical bugs** - All major issues from previous sessions resolved
4. **Git commit needed** - Modified files not yet committed

---

## How to Resume Work Tomorrow

1. Open this file (`PROJECT_STATUS.md`) to get context
2. Test swipe controls on mobile device if available
3. Ask user about "small adjustments" they mentioned for Word Snake game
4. Await direction on next features to build

---

## User Preferences & Style Notes
- Prefers clear explanations with code context
- Appreciates seeing file paths and line numbers
- Likes to test features after implementation
- Uses Supabase for checking data directly
- Works iteratively with testing between changes

**Session ended with Word Snake swipe controls successfully implemented. Ready to continue development tomorrow!**
